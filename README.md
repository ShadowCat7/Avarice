### What is this?

This is a WIP HTML5 game. Top down 'twin-stick' shooter.

### Why Should I Care?

Maybe it will be fun to play at some point.

### How Do I Get It To Run?

There's a demo at [http://shadowcat7.net/avarice/index.html](http://shadowcat7.net/avarice/index.html).

If you want to build it run `browserify client.js > bundle.js`.
