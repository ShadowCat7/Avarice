### What is this?

This is a WIP HTML5 game. It is a top down shooter.

### Why Should I Care?

Maybe it will be fun to play at some point. 

### How Do I Play It?

There's a demo at [http://shadowcat7.net/avarice/index.html](http://shadowcat7.net/avarice/index.html). The controls are WASD for movement and arrow keys to shoot. Press escape to pause.

### How Do I Build It Myself?

I built a bundle using browserify: `browserify client.js > bundle.js`. `index.html` has a script tag with `bundle.js` as the SRC.
